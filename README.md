# NodeJS marine radar library

**Warning: This is so far just a prototype. It does not really work yet.**

This is a nodejs wrapper for the radar receiver classes of [the OpenCPN radar plugin](https://github.com/opencpn-radar-pi/radar_pi),
making it possible to use them outside of OpenCPN and get direct programmatic access to radar imagery.

This opens the possibility to do experimentation on advanced image analysis on radar imagery, e.g. using machine learning or existing traditional computer vision libraries.
